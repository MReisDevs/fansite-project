<p id="introquote">Ruin has come to our family. <br>
You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial, gazing proudly from its stoic perch above the moor.<br>
I lived all my years in that ancient rumor shadowed manor, fattened by decadence and luxury, and yet I began to tire of... conventional extravagance. <br> 
Singular unsettling tales suggested the mansion itself was a gateway to some fabulous and unnameable power. <br>
With relic and ritual, I bent every effort towards the excavation and recovery of those long buried secrets, exhausting what remained of our family fortune on... swarthy workmen and... sturdy shovels. <br>
At last, in the salt soaked crags beneath the lowest foundations, we unearthed that damnable portal of antediluvian evil. <br>
Our every step unsettled the ancient earth, but we were in a realm of death and madness. <br>
In the end, I alone fled, laughing and wailing through those blackened arcades of antiquity. <br> 
Until consciousness failed me. <br>
You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial, it is a festering abomination.<br> 
I beg you, return home, claim your birthright and deliver our family from the ravenous clutching shadows of the <strong>Darkest Dungeon.</strong></p>

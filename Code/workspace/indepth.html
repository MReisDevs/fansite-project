<h1 id="headtwo">Red Hook Studios and More About Darkest Dungeon</h1>
<h2 id="redhook">Red Hook Studios</h2>
<p id="rhstudio">Red Hook Studios was founded by Christ Bourassa and Tyler Sigman. The two men had met and become friends while working together at Backbone Entertainment. During their time at Backbone Entertainment, 
they began discussing the idea of building a game together and brainstorming what it would be. After issues arose in finding time for this side project, they decided in April of 2013 to leave their current job and found Red Hook to start
making Darkest Dungeon a reality. As part of this they ran their successful Kickstarter campaign which ultimately funded the development of the game and allowed them to expanded the studio to include about half a dozen individuals who brought 
together in a little under two years a title that would go on to win Game of the Year from multiple sources and has sold over a million copies as of November 03, 2016.</p>

<h2 id="ddid">The Darkest Dungeon... in Depth</h2>
<p id="ddidtext">At its core, Darkest Dungeon is a dungeon crawler focused heavily on party and resource management. As you start out the game, the tutorial immediately throws you into your first dungeon and do not think for a minute
it plans to go easy on you as it is completely possible to fail the tutorial dungeon and many have succumbed to their first encounter with combat. After surviving the tutorial though, your wagon makes it to the hamlet where your ancestral home 
awaits.<br>
All visitors to the hamlet come by stagecoach and it is at the stagecoach that you will find heroes and adventurers of a number of different classes ready to join you on your adventurers. In the hamlet there are a number of locations 
such as the Monastery, Tavern, and Inn. These locations offer various forms of escape from the terrors of the bleak landscape in the game and over time become increasingly more crucial to the survival of your adventurers as with each battle,
trap, and mishap they encounter they become increasingly stressed and prone to different negative side effects culminating in an instantly fatal heart attack of an otherwise healthy character. Because of this need to let characters rest and relax
it becomes necessary to build a rotation of parties to go into the dungeons.<br>
Once you embark on a mission into a dungeon, you are brought to the shop and given the chance to buy food, torches, and other provisions you may need in the dungeon. There is no obligation to purchase anything and you will be able to scavenge for some supplies 
in the dungeon however if you run short on supplies, darkness leads to insanity, hunger to unrest and starvation, and without bandages a slight wound could soon turn much worse. Dungeons get progressively larger and progressively hard with each mounting success
but failure can come at a cost. Run quick enough and the effects may be minimal but hesitate a moment too long and it could mean death for one of your party and once they die, a character cannot be brought back and permanently goes to the graveyard in the Hamlet. <br>
To defeat the game, your goal is to get through every dungeon until you reach the Darkest Dungeon itself and save your home from the clutches of evil but how long that takes and how many lives are sacrificed in the process will depend completely on the decisions
made by the player in preparing for and conquering the dungeon. <br>
Half the beauty of the game however, is in its artwork and animation. Creative Director Chris Bourassa's style is simple but expressive, dark but captivating and Technical Artist Brooks Gordon has worked very hard to ensure all the animations
fit the style to perfection. While playing, one can't help but admire the beauty and attention to detail while feeling utter disgust at the grotesque Lovecraftian horrors waiting to wipe out your squad around every corner.

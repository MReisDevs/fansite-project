<h1 id="headint">Interview with Brooks Gordon and Keir Miron</h1>
<h2>Two members of the Darkest Dungeon Dev Team</h2>
<p>On March 5, 2016 I had the unique pleasure of getting to sit down and have a conversation with two members of the Darkest Dungeon development team, Technical Artist Brooks Gordon and Programmer Keir Miron, live on Twitch with three of my closest friends (CJtheRocker, OhNoPorkchop, & Sylverbkwolf) as 
a cohost of the now defunct Backseat Gaming Talkshow. <br>
Throughout the interview, a number of topics were covered, including what both developers contributed to the game, the overall development process of the game, what lay ahead for both Darkest Dungeon (and there were some subtle hints at the now recently released DLC)
and Red Hook studios at that time, as well as just generally discussing life for all of us and the gaming community as a whole.<br>
I could not resist including this interview on the site as both Brooks and Keir are genuinely fun people and it does give some insight to the passion shared among the team at Red Hook!</p>
